      <h2> Review </h2>
      <h4> General Review</h4>
        <p>Takizawa kabuki zero is actually an amazing thing. It's quite refreshing because modern boy groups are introducing foreign fans to Japanese culture. It's an amazing mixture between a concert and a kabuki. There are scenes of modern dance and scenes of really amazing traditional acts. The traditional acts are really stunning. You can see the amount of effort and practice Snowman has done to achieve this.
        <p>The second section/act is also really amazing Omaruâ€™s character is one of the funniest character i've seen in any media ever. The 4th wall breaks are also really funny. </p>
      <h4>Cinematography</h4>
        <p>It actually looks like a stage play. The interactive camera going backstage and through the wings of the stage when abe-chan cat/koala(?) is running to fight the bad guys. The director also did an amazing job making the whole thing look like it's a long continuous shot when in actuality there's a couple takes (i watched this with my dad and he thought it was a one take too). The camera movements it's just impressive. Capturing the vast movements of all the backflips and dancings. </p>
