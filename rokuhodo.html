      <h1>Rokuhōdō Yotsuiro Biyori</h1>
      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <p>Togoku Kyosui runs a traditional Japanese style cafe called Rokuhodo. He has a tender voice and hardly ever raises it. He is an honest person with a bright personality. At the cafe, Togoku Kyosui works with three other young men. They each wear a kimono and serve drinks, meals and desserts to their customers. These 4 men interact with their customers, who all have their own problems, and provide them with comfort. While performing their jobs, they also face their own problems and grow as a person.

      <h2> Review </h2>
        <p>I think rokuhodo is a really nice light storyline to watch in one sitting. This was such a heartwarming and funny series. I was hooked before the first episode ended. The script was excellent because it had just the right amount of comedy, drama and quirkiness. It's a really relaxing series but the storyline is quite sad and brought me to tears on separate occasions. The main characters, especially Tokitaka, were so much more interesting and fleshed out. Their relationships were more substantiated and it was easier to see why they're so close. The characters has enough friendly banter and its really cute seeing them interact together. The relationship between Gure and Tsubaki are like brothers. Gure’s 24/7 cute teasing of Tsubaki’s cute persona matched with Tsubaki’s tsun personality is the cutest thing ever and refuels the moe energy. The relationship between Tokitaka and Sui is also really cute. You know I am a sucker for a family-esque relationship. Sui as the leader of the Rokuhodou gang paired with Tokitaka’s gentle nature and motherly personality is a great minefield for the fanfic writers. Its also joked inside the series that the other characters call Tokitaka as “Mother” or “Mama” and Sui as the “Father” or “Papa '' which greatly adds to the cuteness of the TokiSui ship and symbolizes the Rokuhodo as a one big family. I love the cast and how they portrayed their characters. The friendship between the main characters and their customers was great. I also have to mention the obvious overtones of bromance in the series which is fine with me. The foods presented there looks absolutely amazing. Especially the Omurice, it makes me want to teleport to the rokuhodo universe and inhale the foods. The cinematography is also really amazing. It greatly captures the feeling of the customers when walking inside the restaurant. Like an escape from reality. Away from the gloomy stress from the workplace and into the brightly lit and colourful restaurant.
