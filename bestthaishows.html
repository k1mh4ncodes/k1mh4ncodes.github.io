      <h1>Top 10 best thai shows </h1>
      <h2>The Gifted</h2>
        <img src="img/thegifted.jpg" alt="image of The Gifted" width="750px">
        <p> the series follows a low-class student who is accelerated to an elite, secretive program where students are trained to discover and develop their supernatural abilities. The plot is smart, refreshing and stylish. The tensions and characters are slowly and progressively built, teasing the audience and making us keep watching. The season is divided in two parts. The first one introduces the characters and their habilities while the second portion focus on the secret of the school. </p>
      <h2> Girl from Nowhere </h2>
      <img src="img/girlfromnowhere.jpg" alt="image of Girl From Nowhere" width="750px">
        <p> The plot revolves around Nanno, an enigmatic girl who transfers to different private schools in Thailand and exposes the students and faculty's stories of lies, secrets, and hypocrisy.The show was amazing it wasn't afraid to go to some dark unforgivable places, plot had me hooked and the music was great. This drama takes the role of "bullied girl fights back with a vengeance" to a deliciously new level.</p>
      <h2> Until We Meet Again </h2>
      <img src="img/uwma.jpg" alt="until we meet again" width="750px"
        <p> The story about two modern-day college students who discover that they are the reincarnated souls of two past lovers who had committed suicide. Until We Meet Again is unique drama in its genre in many ways: it has unique story, exceptional acting and tackles some very hard, but important, subjects like homophobia, domestic violence and suicide, but also love, friendship and forgiveness.</p>
      <h2>KinnPorsche</h2>
      <img src="img/kaypee.jpg" alt="Kinnporsce the series" width="750px"
        <p>Kinn, the second son of a prominent mafia head, is ambushed by an enemy and meets Porsche, a college student who comes to his rescue, thus beginning their reluctant relationship as boss and bodyguard, which soon turns into something more. Amazing drama with heavy storylines. Its really rare for a thai draama to be this quality with amazing cinematography. A really anti-mainstream concept that sets it apart from any other dramas.</p>
      <h2>F4 Thailand Boys Over Flowers</h2>
      <img src="img/f4thailand.jpg" alt="F4 thailand boys over flowers" width="750px"
        <p>The school is was ruled by an elite clique known as the F4, consisting of 4 rich, handsome, and spoiled boys. Gorya is was the only one that stands up to their bullying ways, leaving all the boys in awe, especially Thyme, the group's leader.  The actings and storytellings, the symbolic meanings,all down to every little details.</p>
