      <h1>My School President</h1>
        <h2>Summary</h2>
          <p>The son of the principal, Tinn is instructed to axe any clubs that don't boost their school's reputation. The music club tops that list and Tinn is therefore Gun's number one enemy. Desperate to save his club, Gun will do anything, even pledge servitude to Tinn. When Tinn learns Chinzhilla has a rule that band members aren't permitted to date until they win the Hot Wave Music Contest, he vows to do whatever it takes to help them do just that.</p>

        <h2> Review </h2>
          <p>My school president has a really light storyline but unlike most dramas with a light storyline, it has a solid storyline that makes you hooked, things actually happen in the series and the characters don't stroll around and do nothing. It's a perfect balance between a light story but an amazing plot. Unlike most characters in most BL dramas, these characters actually have brains. When there's conflict in the relationship, the characters communicate with their partners. They do not make you scream to the screen like ‚Äúoh my god (insert character) what are you doing!!! you could solve this problem in 5 minutes by by talking to (insert other character) instead of it taking 13 episodes of misunderstandings ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨‚Äù The character of Tinn is also a really funny person. If you watch the original teaser you would expect him to be a really toxic and bad person but apparently he is really understanding of his partner and he is also really sweet.
In most BL dramas, they act like lesbian couples do not exists so i have to give an extra point to this series for having a lesbian couple because their interactions are the cutest. Even though they only appear for less than 5 minutes it's better than nothing. When Winny and Pat found out that the girls they were hitting on are gay, they did not do the ‚Äúi can change her '' nonsense but they respected their relationship and didn't continue hitting on them. It was also nice that there were no coming out scenes or homophobic scenes and I love it a lot when BL dramas do this because they just ignore real life and just say that this is how the world should be (which it should). And it can hopefully translate to the real world.
The acting are 100% going to give you butterflies. When i was watching this i was screaming, crying, kicking my feet, curling my toes. All of the above because their chemistry is on p-o-i-n-t. </p>
<p>The OST are also amazing. Unfortunately it's quite rare to see someone in the acting industry being able to sing. All of the cast here can sing surprisingly well. Satang‚Äôs guitar skills are also amazing. The songs are absolute earworms. I also love how they incorporate the songs to the storyline like in episode 5. Where they incorporate the song Just Being Friendly by Tilly Birds to the episode. The song also reflected their current status of the relationship. I might have a bias in this part because tilly birds is my favourite band but i love their cover of that song. </p>
